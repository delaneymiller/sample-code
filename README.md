Description: This repository contains a couple samples of my Matlab code in image analysis and computational fluid dynamics.

Image analysis: miller_fiber_image_analysis.m
Description:

Computational fluid dynamics: miller_cylinder.m
Dependencies: defineCylinder.m, cylinderInterior.m, reassignCylinder.m
Description:  This Matlab script simulates unsteady, two-dimensional convective flow over an isothermal cylinder in a 300 x 500 grid using iterative numerical methods.

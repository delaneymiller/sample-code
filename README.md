Author: Delaney Miller

Description: This repository contains a couple samples of my Matlab code in image analysis and computational fluid dynamics.


Image analysis: miller_fiber_image_analysis.m

Description: This Matlab script takes fluorescent microscopy images and calculates the density of particle adherence to to fibers in the images.


Computational fluid dynamics: miller_cylinder.m

Dependencies: defineCylinder.m, cylinderInterior.m, reassignCylinder.m

Simulations: miller_cylinder_temperature.avi, miller_cylinder_vorticity.avi

Description:  This Matlab script simulates unsteady, two-dimensional convective flow over an isothermal cylinder in a 300 x 500 grid using iterative numerical methods.
